"Every week a profile is selected that stands out based on quality of content, readability, formatting, and overall  flow.","Daniel did a great job with the Executive Profile updates. His analyst commentary provides insight into each executive's responsibilities and highlights previous positions or facts about the executive that might be helpful to the sales rep. He also found a connection between one of the executives and a Kronos customer. There are a few formatting issues to note: the bullets in the analyst commentary should be lined up with the commentary box and the analyst commentary should be in italics. Overall, excellent work Daniel!   As a reminder, executive profile analyst commentary should include roles and responsibilities of the executive, their tenure with the company,  pertinent quotes from the executive, connections to Kronos customers, and any other information that might be important for the sales rep to note.
